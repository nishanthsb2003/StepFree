🦿 StepFree – Affordable, Eco-Friendly Prosthetic Leg

From Disability to Ability. From Mobility to Freedom.

🚨 Problem Statement

5M+ amputees in India are underserved (WHO).

Imported prosthetics cost ₹2–5 Lakh → unaffordable for 80% families.

Jaipur Foot is cheap (~₹10–20k) but lacks comfort, durability, and modern design.

Rural India: 70% of amputees have no access to advanced prosthetic clinics.

👉 Result: 8 out of 10 amputees live without mobility, independence, or dignity.
