🦿 StepFree – AI-Assisted, Eco-Friendly Prosthetic Leg
From Disability to Ability. From Mobility to Freedom.
🚨 Problem Statement

5M+ amputees in India struggle without proper prosthetic solutions (WHO).

Imported prosthetic legs cost ₹2–5 lakh, far beyond what 80% of families can afford.

Low-cost models (₹10–20k) like Jaipur Foot lack durability, comfort, and modern motion functionality.

70% of amputees live in rural/semi-urban areas, with little or no access to prosthetic clinics.

👉 Result: 8 out of 10 amputees live without mobility, employment, or dignity.

💡 Our Solution — StepFree

StepFree is an affordable, modular, eco-friendly prosthetic leg designed for India and developing nations.
It integrates AI-assisted knee movement, EMG-based intent detection, and shock absorption — all under a budget Indian families can afford.

⭐ Key Features (Crisp & Powerful)

🧠 AI-Powered Knee Motion
Trained AI predicts user intent and automates knee angles (0° & 45°).

⚡ Neural EMG Control
Non-invasive EMG patches capture muscle signals for Rest/Lift actions.

💰 Ultra-Low-Cost Build
90% cheaper than imports — production feasible at ₹10k–₹18k.

🖨️ 3D-Printed Custom Fit
3D scanning + printing deliver a perfect, personalized socket.

🌱 Modular & Eco-Friendly Materials
Bamboo, hemp, recycled plastics, aluminium, rubber.

🦿 Integrated Shock Absorber
Reduces impact, improves comfort, and supports natural gait.

🚐 Portable Fabrication
On-the-spot production during rural outreach clinics.
